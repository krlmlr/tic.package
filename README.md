A minimal example package with _pkgdown_ documentation created and uploaded by [_tic_](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/tic) (the _pkgdown_ documentation is written to, and served from, the `docs` directory of the `master` branch.).
_tic_ is an R package for CI-agnostic workflow definitions for various R projects. 
See its [documentation](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/tic/) for more information.

## Set up an operational fork of this repository

If you want to experiment with _travis_ and _tic_ for a R package, you can fork it.

1. Use `usethis::create_from_github()` to automatically create a fork of this repo.
    If you use RStudio, a new RStudio project will open. 
    You may need to set up your SSH credentials first. 
    See [this guide](http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html) if you're having problems. 
    (It's definitely worth getting this function running as it saves you a lot of time in the future!) 
    Alternatively, fork this repo on Github and then create a new R Project within RStudio (File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Github). 
1. Run `tic::use_tic()` to set up all requirements needed for the CI integration of your package.

## Create a package from scratch

This is the detailed way going step by step from the bottom up.
Looking here can be useful if you already have an R package and just want to add some functionality to it, e.g. using _roxygen2_ with Markdown (item 3) or enabling CI for your package (item 6).

1. Use `usethis::create_package("<path-to-package-dir>")`. 
    Here is an example with a package called `tic.package` stored within the `~/git/` directory:
    
    ```r
    usethis::create_package("~/git/tic.package")
    ✔ Changing active project to '/home/<username>/git/tic.package'
    ✔ Creating 'R/'
    ✔ Creating 'man/'
    ✔ Writing 'DESCRIPTION'
    ✔ Writing 'NAMESPACE'
    ✔ Writing 'tic.package.Rproj'
    ✔ Adding '.Rproj.user' to '.gitignore'
    ✔ Adding '^tic.package\\.Rproj$', '^\\.Rproj\\.user$' to '.Rbuildignore'
    ✔ Opening new project 'tic.package' in RStudio
    ```

2. Initialize Git via `usethis::use_git()`:

    ```
    ✔ Changing active project to '/home/<username>/git/tic.package'
    ✔ Initialising Git repo
    ✔ Adding '.Rhistory', '.RData' to '.gitignore'
    OK to make an initial commit of 5 files?
    1: Yup
    2: No
    3: Absolutely not

    Selection: 1
    ✔ Adding files and committing
    ● A restart of RStudio is required to activate the Git pane
    ● Restart now?
    1: Absolutely
    2: No way
    3: Absolutely not

    Selection: 1
    ```

3. (Optional) Use _roxygen2_ with Markdown support for package documentation: `usethis::use_roxygen_md()`:

    ```r
    ✔ Changing active project to '/home/<username>/git/tic.package'
    ✔ Setting Roxygen field in DESCRIPTION to 'list(markdown = TRUE)'
    ✔ Setting RoxygenNote field in DESCRIPTION to '6.0.1.9000'
    ● Run `devtools::document()`
    ```

4. Add a license: `usethis::add_gpl3_license()` (or any license of your choice):

     ```r
    ✔ Changing active project to '/home/<username>/git/tic.package'
    ✔ Setting License field in DESCRIPTION to 'GPL-3'
    ✔ Writing 'LICENSE.md'
    ✔ Adding '^LICENSE\\.md$' to '.Rbuildignore'
    ```

5. Create a Github repo by using `usethis::use_github()`:

    ```r
    ● Check title and description
      Name:        tic.package
      Description: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)
    Are title and description ok?
    1: No way
    2: I agree
    3: Nope

    Selection: 2
    ✔ Creating GitHub repository
    ✔ Adding GitHub remote
    ✔ Adding GitHub links to DESCRIPTION
    ✔ Setting URL field in DESCRIPTION to 'https://github.com/<user>/tic.package'
    ✔ Setting BugReports field in DESCRIPTION to 'https://github.com/<user>/tic.package/issues'
    ✔ Pushing to GitHub and setting remote tracking branch
    ```

6. Set up Continuous Integration by using `usethis::use_ci()`:

     ```r
    Authenticating with GitHub
    Waiting for authentication in browser...
    Press Esc/Ctrl + C to abort
    Authentication complete.
    ✔ Changing active project to '/home/<username>/git/tic.package'
    Authenticating with Travis
    Authenticating with GitHub
    Waiting for authentication in browser...
    Press Esc/Ctrl + C to abort
    Authentication complete.
    Finished initiating sync with GitHub.
    Waiting for sync with GitHub....
    Finished sync with GitHub.
    Finished activating repo <user>/tic.package on Travis CI.
    Added .travis.yml from template.
    ✔ Adding '^\\.travis\\.yml$' to '.Rbuildignore'
    Added appveyor.yml from template.
    ✔ Adding '^appveyor\\.yml$' to '.Rbuildignore'
    Added tic.R from template.
    ✔ Adding '^tic\\.R$' to '.Rbuildignore'
    Authenticating with GitHub
    Waiting for authentication in browser...
    Press Esc/Ctrl + C to abort
    Authentication complete.
    Finished adding deploy keys on GitHub for repo <user>/tic.package.
    Successfully added public deploy key 'travis+tic' to GitHub for <user>/tic.package. You should receive a confirmation e-mail
    from GitHub. Delete the key in the repository's settings when you no longer need it.
    Finished adding private environment variable id_rsa to <user>/tic.package on Travis CI.
    Successfully added private deploy key to <user>/tic.package as secure environment variable id_rsa to Travis CI.
    Create a personal access token, make sure that you are signed in as the correct user. The suggested description 'travis+tic 
    for <user>/tic.package' has been copied to the clipboard. If you use this token only to avoid GitHub's rate limit, you can  
    leave all scopes unchecked. Then, copy the new token to the clipboard, it will be detected and applied automatically. Please
    visit https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
    A browser window will be opened.
    Waiting for PAT to appear on the clipboard.
    Detected PAT, clearing clipboard.
    Finished adding private environment variable GITHUB_PAT to <user>/tic.package on Travis CI.
```
